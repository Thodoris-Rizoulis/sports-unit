## Clarification Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Always ask for clarification before proceeding with changes if the user's request is ambiguous, contains questions, or requires confirmation. Do not assume intent or proceed with implementation without explicit confirmation when the user asks questions or expresses uncertainty. Wait for user response before making any code changes.
